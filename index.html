	<h1>The ummm... The Day of Reckoning is... it's ermm... it's here!!!</h1>
	
	<button>That's not my name...</button>

	<h3>H-Heed my dire warning!!</h3>
	
	<p>
	I truly d-do regret to inform you, humble citizen, however... w-well... erm... how do I put this...you-you see...
	The day of Reckoning has, erm, arrived, and it brings with it <strong>t-terrible</strong> things, in-including, but n-not limited to:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>The Awakening of the Old Ones</li>
	<li>The Feast! The Feast! The Feast!</li>
	<li>The Slaughter of the Masses</li>
	<li>The Great Plague</li>
	<li>Increased Cancer Rates</li>
	<li>Loss of Fertility</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	W-Wait, those last two were just causes of lead p-poisoning, my apologies. I belive t-they handed out a umm... pamphlet of sorts,
	detailing all of the major events, and whatnot... i-it had a schedule and everything, however I... erm, well I-I seem to have... erm... misplaced it.
	D-Don't look at me like that! It truly w-was not that important.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Hey! L-Lighten up a bit!</h3>
	
	<p>
	You look quite glum, but uhh... The Day of Reckoning isn't all that bad! When life get's me down, I-I listen to my favorite podcast! Yes! 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TalkTuahPod">Here, take a listen</a>, you'll see what I mean, I swear it! ...B-But only if y-you want!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I erm, hope that made you f-feel a bit better... i-if you listened to it. ...T-this is getting a bit t-too awkward for m-my taste, so erm...
	I-I think I'm going to go home now. I wish you g-good fortune throughout The Day of Reckoning... I g-guess...
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>See you around...?</strong></p>
